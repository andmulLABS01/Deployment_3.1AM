The Story
-----------------------------------------
Weâ€™re a tech start-up company with a URL shortener tool. We have a SLA with Nike to provide them access to our URL shortener. In the SLA, we are only allowed 20 minutes of downtime a year. If anything happens to the URL shortener, we must communicate any incidents to Nike.
 
Scenario
-----------------------------------------
A new hire was tasked with updating the URL shortener. The new hire committed version 2 of the application to the main branch. Which automatically triggered a build, test, and deploy to the production server, replacing version 1 of the application running on the server.

Post-incident report 
-----------------------------------------
- What was the reason for the incident?

  * The reason for the incident was a commit performed by a new hire of Version 2 of the application to the main branch, which triggered a Build, Test, Deploy to the
production environment, which replaced Version 1 of the application.  

- How long was the site down or malfunctioning?

  * The site malfunctioned for approximately 5 minutes from discovery to resolution.
  
- What steps were taken to resolve the incident?

  1. Initial report of the incident and information gathering; initial options were to roll back or troubleshoot; troubleshooting was selected.
  1. Logged into the AWS instance and requested the error logs (last 100 rows), found errors relating to JSON
  1. Look into the application.py file, look at the JSON configurations, and found an error with the syntax
  1. Fixed the error and redeployed the application via Jenkins

- Was the incident fully resolved?

  * Yes, the error was fully resolved, and the application functioned properly.  Nike was notified of the incident and we will present a full Root Cause Analysis (RCA) 

- What steps would you take to prevent this from happening again?
  
  1. Include a review process of all code changes to ensure proper functioning before deployment
  1. Rollback instead of troubleshooting to reduce downtime.
  1. Restrict new hire ability to push changes to production.
